# BrenerBot ü§ñ

An easy to use WhatsApp utility bot, written in TypeScript.
Designed mainly for group chats!

> **Warning**
> BrenerBot relies on Baileys to connect to the WhatsApp API. The connection _should_ be
> stable and not trigger any bans. However, WhatsApp hates fun, so consider it as a possibility,
> don't do anything stupid and pay attention to the API limits.

## Getting started

### Configure Your Bot

Create a config.json file from the config.json.example file:

_config.json_

```json
{
  "botPrefix": "!",
  "countryCode": "US",
  "phoneNumber": "2133734253"
}
```

BrenerBot will respond only to messages that start with the `botPrefix`, and exactly follow the command syntax.

`countryCode` and `phoneNumber` are used to specify the owner's phone number. This is a privilleged user and has additional command-running permissions.

`countryCode` should contain the owner's country code as a two-letters string (ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2). [Click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for a complete list.

`phoneNumber` should contain the owner's phone number, without any prefix. This includes a plus sign, a country code or any leading zeros.

### Install Dependencies

BrenerBot requires the following software:

- NodeJS
- ffmpeg

After installing the requirements above and adding them to the PATH environment variable, you can use the following command to install all of the required libraries:

```
npm install
```

### Compile & Run

This project contains three built-in scripts, written for unix and unix-like systems. On other operating systems, mainly windows, you will need to manually edit those scripts and replace OS-specific commands (currently only `rm -r build`).

#### Compile: Recompile TypeScript files into JavaScript

```
npm run compile
```

#### Run: Run BrenerBot

```
npm run run
```

#### Start: Recompile & Run!

```
npm start
```

And that's it!

### Optional: Add Commands!

BrenerBot is build with a high level of modularity in mind. You can add your own commands by creating command files in a sub-directory under 'src/commands' and
conforming with the command structure, as specified in 'src/commands/commands.ts'. Make sure to include this sub-directory in 'src/commands/categories.ts' and define the corresponding category name in native language.

A command file should look like this:

```typescript
import {
  Command,
  GroupChatPermissions,
  PrivateChatPermissions,
} from "../commands";
import { Client, Message } from "whatsapp-web.js";

let command: Command = {
  permissions: {
    groupChat: GroupChatPermissions.Everyone,
    privateChat: PrivateChatPermissions.Owner,
  },

  nativeText: {
    name: "ping",
    description: "pongs!",
    category: "misc",
  },

  async execute(client: Client, msg: Message, args: string[]) {
    if (args.length) return;
    await msg.reply("pong! üèì");
  },
};

module.exports = command;
```

Share your commands with us :)
